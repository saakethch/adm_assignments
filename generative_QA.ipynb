       "[\"all right so this is the new 13-inch m2macbook pro and i don't think anyoneshould actually buy it wait what yeah noi think it's a great computer first ofall don't get me wrong but with theintroduction of the m2 macbook air andthe existence of the 14-inch m1 promacbook pro they've managed to squeezeany reason for this machine to exist atthis priceto basically zero nobody should buy ityeah but nobody that i mean that seemspretty harsh matter of fact i'm here letme challenge you on thatthis is a great computer changed my mindokay well let's just start with thedesign so apple's been going throughtheir laptop lineup upgrading everythingwith this new square shape largerdisplays with thinner bezels getting ridof the touch bar and actually addingports but this particular refresh didn'tget any of that so this brand new laptoplooks exactly the same as the m1 macbookpro from two years ago which looksexactly the same as the 13-inch intelmacbook pro with the touch bar thatdropped in 2016 because it is exactlythe same i could give him sustainabilitycredit i guess for recycling an olddesign and apparently using the sameboxes from the m1 macbook pro just withnew stickers on them but yeah this exactshell design is literally six years oldand is starting to look kind of out ofplace now next to apple's othernotebooks like can you imagine any othercompany trying to reuse a six-year-olddesign like you trying to tell me a2016 asus laptop re-release would flytoday like a six-year-old xps drop likethat's wild yeah but this isn't thatlike let me tell you uh if it ain'tbroke don't fix it and i'm not justsaying that like this is a really goodlaptop design all metal jacket a plushinge and let me just remind you youreviewed it and you loved it the screenwas bright and high resolution still isthe speakers were best in class stillare great track pad and keyboard and bythe way some people do really like thetouch bar you said so yourself it mightnot do a whole lot but it still has itsfew advantages okay but that that is ina vacuum like that's the thing by itselfi would agree with you this computer isa perfectly good laptop buy it but assoon as you put it alongside the newmacbook air which is basically the sameprice it's actually worse at basicallyeverything like i got hands on time withthe new m2 macbook air that's about tocome out next month right the air has alarger display with thinner bezels andin that notch there's a new 1080p webcaminstead of a 6 year old 720p webcam ithas magsafe with a color matching cablewhich enables fast charging andessentially frees up an extra port sincethat's one more usb-c port that you'renot plugged into and it's all in apackage that's thinner weighs less andis basically the same price so why wouldyou buy this macbook pro how is it evenpro anymore you know what that's a goodquestion why would you buythis prothe answer i think first of all is it isthe cheapest pro in the lineuptechnically it's true but really thereason you get this over the air is thethicker chassis supports active coolingso it's got a fan and all the benefitsthat come with that i mean thebenchmarks are in and to the surprise ofabsolutely no one it's pretty clear thatthis m2 chip is awesome it's living upto the 10 to 20 percent bettermulti-core cpu performance and even moreimpressively the two extra gpu coresover m1 is giving it 30 to 40 percentbetter gpu performance which isbasically the only area where you couldsay m1 was lacking so this is awesomefor any applications that lean on thegpu everything's faster final cut isfaster premiere is faster any games youmight play are all faster and the cherryon top is it has a dramatically improvedmedia engine same one from the higherend chips actually so you can actuallypull off some heavier final cut proedits so for something like that whileyou're in a program for hours and thingsare getting hot okay that's when youneed the fans to kick in keepperformance highlonger than the macbook air ever couldno throttling so if you've got thesustained workloads and the longperformance stuff you should get the m2macbook pro no no those people shouldjust go straight to the 14 inch m1 promacbook pro just go straight to the bigbrother look if you know you're going tobe doing workloads and things that themacbook air can't handlethen you should just go to the actuallypro laptop the upgraded machineif you're going to get a nice laptop andyou want to do extra performance stuffon it you weren't going to get thebaseline macbook pro right you weregoing to bump it up first of all becauseyou want at least 16 gigs of memoryright and second of all because the 256gigs of baseline pro storage is kind ofinsulting and that version hasparticularly clipped ssd performanceworse than even the m1 macbook pro so toget to one terabyte and 16 gigs you'realready looking at like 1900for this machineat that pointjust get the 14 inch pro because thatlaptop is on another level ofperformance i mean don't get me wrongit's absolutely awesome to see the jumpfrom m1 to m2 and that's going to enablea ton more great stuff for the mostpopular laptop for the everyday baselineusers but if you zoom out there's stilla big difference in performance whenmoving up to the higher end chips m1 proand then m1 max the amount of additionalperformance you get for the extra two tothree hundred dollars is massive ifthat's what you really want that's whatyou should get plus you get a muchbetter brighter mini led high refreshrate screen tooand the webcam and the notch is waybetter much better speakers and actuallyget some ports while you're at it so ijust i don't know you shouldn't get aliteral worse version of all of thosethings i mean two to three hundred bucksisn't nothingi meanit's not zero but likei don't know really squeezes this newmacbook pro quite a bit and plus youcan't get around the fact that it's it'sliterally worse at all those things ithink you're forgetting something uh ohreally the macbook pro has studioquality microphones while the macbookair does not umi mean so technically they both arelisted as having triple microphonearrays with beamforming it's just applechose to call the one in the macbook prostudio quality it might have a slightdifference but really are you gonna payextra for that and then sacrifice allthis other stuff okay i think there isone redeeming factorand what is thatbatterythe macbook pro has surprisinglyexcellent battery life better than ithink pretty much all of us expected wesaw the 20 hours of video playbackquoted on stage but in real world usethis might be the best battery life inany modern laptop we've ever seenthere's people out here getting 16 to 20hours of actual real world use theverge's laptop reviewer monica wrote ahilarious piece about how long it tookher to run down a battery and across theboard it's a tremendously long performerso if you want the best battery in anylaptop get this one okay so that isawesome to seebut at the same time those other laptopsalready have great battery life too soyou're not trying to spendjust to get a slightly better batteryand then sacrifice all those otherthings we talked aboutit's really quite a small difference uhso the ideal customer for this newmacbook pro m2is somebody who just needs a slightlybetter sustained performance than thenew macbook air and is willing tosacrifice screen size webcam speakersports thickness and weight to get itor someone who is literally about to buythe 13-inch m1 macbook proenterpriseyep enterprise that's

       " \"apple m2 is finally here and we'regetting our first taste of it in thisproduct the m2 equipped 13-inch macbookpro which is actually running a lot ofdated hardware and some of it is likesix years old at this point but i wasable to compare this m2 equipped productwith the m1 products from the previousgeneration as well as some of the bigboy m1 pro products and this new m2 chipis really good the cpu is like 10 tomaybe 15 better than what was availablein m1 like the base m1 it's not aspowerful as like m1 pro m1 mac stuff butit's a decent step up but in terms ofthe gpu this is massively better it'slike 35 40 better than what wasavailable in m1 and i think that's verysignificant because the gpu was i thinkthe weakest point of the base m1products like they were good but theyweren't great gpus the m2 product is somuch better it's partly because they'rerunning two extra cores on that gpu butm2 on the whole is very fast xcodebuilds are faster final cut is fasterpremiere is faster games are fasterbenchmarks are faster everything'sfaster it's m2 right it's kind of whatyou'd expect from apple for their secondgeneration of apple silicon and if yourworkflow can take advantage of thatspeed and especially if you're inapple's ecosystem and using their appsthis is a fantastic product it still isa five nanometer process on the chip ithas faster clock speeds a couple moregpu cores faster ram but aside from thatm2 chip the rest of the product islargely the same compared to last year'sm1 macbook pro even the battery life ispretty much the same it still has acrazy long battery life and it's areally good system but when you look atwhat else is coming around the cornernamely the m2 macbook air which is muchsleeker and new looking system thequestion people are asking is likewhy does this thing even exist like whydid they only do a chip drop why doesthis not have just a more compellingfeature set behind it especially whenthey're both very similar in price likepeople should just get the new macbookair instead of this macbook pro rightkinda sorta so if you look at lastyear's m1 macbook pro in terms of thecpu this would pull around 15 watts atmaximum you just like put it full tilt15 watt energy draw this here on the m2this pulls about 19 watts it's not amassive jump up in energy consumptionbut it's significant and the same storywith the gpu so this m1 product fromlast year it did about 10 watts at peakthis time around it's like 13 14 wattsit may seem insignificant but it adds upsothis year on m2 it's still a very energyefficient system and it's a muchstronger performerbut it doesn't come for free thatperformance costs energy and producesheat and in a laptop that's small likethis you try to get rid of that heatright the m2 macbook pro has a fan themacbook air does not and on m2 becausethese chips draw a little bit moreenergy than m1 did i think that thedifference in performance at the top endin terms of like sustained performanceis gonna be quite different between whata fanless system can do versus what afan equipped system can do like when youwant to maintain a high level ofperformance for like you know 20-30minutes i think the macbook pro will doa lot better especially in a systemthat's small like this now because appleis launching their new chip the new m2chip this is a very important ship tothem it's like their new baby right thisis representing their not just thisproduct but the future m2 based productsto come this has to perform really welland they're going to choose a fanequipped system to showcase it in it'sdated but it does the job it is an olddesign and the bezels look extra thickon this device but it's still a reallysolid system great performance goodbattery life and for enterprisecustomers if you're buying for corporateand you're buying hundreds or thousandsor tens of thousands of macbooks at atime i think you can get way betterdiscounts on this machine than you wouldfor the upcoming m2 macbook airokay i just want to wrap up thisconversation withi guess my overall thoughts on thisproduct so when this thing came in ithought i would rip on it right aproduct like thisshould not work in 2022 like it reallyshouldn't with hardware that's this oldlike there's so much of it that's sodated that the user experience i imaginewould have been heavily compromisedespecially when you're surrounded bylike really good high performancedevices from windows and just otheroptions thatdon't have six year old aesthetics onthem rightif you're looking at this thing withneutral eyes this is still a very goodproduct it's arguably one of the bestlaptops still despite it being loadedwith so much archaic stuff anditthe truth is i think it just boils downto being apple not because they'remarketing not because of the brandingbut because apple controls the wholestack right they control everything fromthe design of the product to thehardware that goes in it to theoperating system to even theapplications that people are even ableto use on these systems it's not goodcontrol but it is controlled because thecontroller allthe user experience is so finely tunedit's so well engineered that you can getaway withthisold hardware because the user experienceis still really really goodit's a good thing if you're into applebut it's a really weird thing as areviewer because you're like how do yourecommend something like thiswhen you shouldn't but you but it justworks it just does but if you thinkabout it from windows perspectivemy god like i never thought about thisbefore but windows devices like windowslaptops they have to work with so manyvendors so many companies like you gotto deal with intel's chips or amd'schips then you got to work with nvidiato get the graphics card in you got todeal with microsoft for the operatingsystem or with the linux distro you'redealing with like there's so much stuffyou have to take into account and thenthe software like what are theapplications that people use there's somuch stuff you have to take intoconsideration to make a user experiencethat's compelling and good for the userandthe task is way harder for windowsdevices but because of thatthey could never pull this off can youimagine dell selling a six-year-old xpsproduct with just a chip drop likethere's no way they would be able tosell that but this for whatever reasonit still works so there you have it them2 macbook proit's new and very old at the same time[Music]\",\n",
       " '(upbeat music)(upbeat music continues)- So this is the M2 Max MacBook Pro.Let\\'s talk about it.So this week, Apple updated the 14 inchand 16 inch MacBook Pros\\nwith a press releaseand an 18 minute YouTube videothat featured a bunch of\\ncreators at the beginning,which was cool, and then basically\\na whole prerecorded eventthat kind of looked like it\\nwas cut out of another event.Matter of fact, it\\'s rumored thatthis basically was cut out of an eventthat they were rumored\\nto have late last year.Honestly, I buy it,like the URL and the file name\\nof the video had 2022 in themand the AR files for the new laptopswere compiled in October, 2022,suggesting that these things\\nwere ready to go months ago.But whatever, none of that matters.What matters is they\\'re here nowand what you need to\\nknow is on the outside,they\\'re basically identical,but on the inside, instead\\nof M1 Pro and M1 Max,it\\'s M2 Pro and M2 Max,and a couple other tiny improvements also.So the first Apple Silicon MacBook Pros,when they came out in October, 2021,honestly some of the most\\nunanimously well-liked computersI have ever seen.They added back the ports,\\nthey got rid of the touch bar,they brought back MagSafe,they bumped up toan excellent high refresh\\nrate mini LED display,and the performance is incredible.Like across the board,I don\\'t think I\\'ve met a\\nsingle person who got oneand was like, \"Oh, nah, I\\nmade a mistake with this one.\"So when you see a new one\\na year and a half later,there isn\\'t really a ton that\\nwe\\'re expecting to changebecause the big leap was\\nfrom the Intel MacBook Prosto the Apple Silicon ones.Now we\\'re back to more\\nincremental improvements.So as you can imagine,yeah, completely identical on the outside,same sizes, same colors,the only way I can\\ndifferentiate this new onefrom my old 16 inch M1 Maxis the icon skin I\\'ve had on the back.Of course, channel sponsor dbrandis already selling these\\nfor the 2023 model,so if you want your laptop\\nto look a little differentthan every other MacBook Pro in the world,then, yeah, this is your\\nbest bet, link below.So the bulk of what\\'s newis coming from the new chip inside.M2 Pro and M2 Max.They are essentially the same price tiersand configurations across\\nthe board as beforebut Apple is quoting now\\n20% more CPU performanceand 30% better GPU performance.This in front of me hereis a maxed out M2 Max with the 38 core GPUand the new maximum of\\n96 gigs of shared memory.Shocker, this thing rips.So under the hood, it\\'s built ona new second gen 5 nanometer process,and they\\'ve added some cores,two more high efficiency CPU coresand three more GPU cores on the Pro,so it\\'s a 19 core GPU on the M2 Pro.And a 38 core GPU on the M2 Max.Also, the neural engine and media engineare improved to handle machine learningand media playback and transcodingeven faster than they already did.If you\\'re into synthetic benchmarks,I did run Geekbench 5and the single core scoreis now the highest I have\\never seen, just over 2,000,while the multi-core\\nscore was north of 15,000.Here\\'s some context to give you an ideaof how impressive these numbers are.And yes, that is aboutthe 20% CPU improvement that we expected.And then, in Cinebench, again,it had a chart topping single core scoreand here\\'s how the multi-core stacks out.So overall capabilities,basically the ceiling has been raised upby the 20 to 30%, which is\\ngreat, but as I mentionedin the original M1 Max\\nreview a year and a half ago,it\\'s not so much about\\nthe raw processing poweras much as it\\'s about the thingsthat it allows you to do\\nbetter or faster than before,hence the name Pro, theoretically.So like I noticed this in thingswhere I have parts of my workflowthat work just right with it.So I have this same I dowhere I screen record with ScreenFlowand it\\'ll do a full\\nresolution screen recordingand then I\\'ll export that and use itand bring into Final Cut Pro.The exporting of that screen recordinginto ProRes 422 was dramatically improvedwhen we got the media\\nengine with Apple Silicon.So a 16 core Intel Mac Prowith a Vega Pro II Duothat retailed for over $15,000,took a three and a half\\nminute screen recordingand churned that out in 56 seconds.But the M1 max laptop\\ndid it in 32 seconds,So that was so sick,that\\'s one of those thingsyou instantly notice is way faster.This new M2 Max did it in 23 seconds.So again, a pretty\\nsubstantial improvement.Like, clearly the outgoing\\nmachines weren\\'t lackingbut they\\'ve taken basically\\neverything that was goodabout the old ones and improved it,just bumped it up a little\\nbit, which is sweet.For everyday daily non-demanding tasksas you can probably imagine,these are still great, totally great.Like, I\\'ve already told you all aboutthe excellent mini LED displaythat has a questionable\\namount of light bleedbut still looks pretty\\ngreat most of the time.I\\'ve already told you\\nabout the top-notch designand all of the metal build quality,the huge track pad, the\\nhigh quality headphone jack,the return of the built-in SD card slot,I\\'ve already told you about all that,but what about those\\nother tiny improvementsI mentioned earlier\\nthat aren\\'t the M2 chip?Well, there\\'s a couple things.So first of all, the\\nextra efficiency coresthat I mentioned earlier are great,of course, for battery life.Not only is the battery\\nlife still really goodbut there\\'s also a claimed extra houron both the 14 inch\\nand 16 inch of battery.I\\'m not seeing a dramatic difference,but, hey, the fact that it\\'s\\nbetter at all, it\\'s sick.And then these laptops still fast chargebut there\\'s also now a color\\nmatching MagSafe cable.Now this is a slight differencesince these laptops are really only silveror slightly darker\\nsilver, but there you go,it\\'s darker now with a\\nspace gray one, it matches,color matching all the way upuntil the white plastic\\nUSB-C nub on the other end.And then there\\'s a few other capabilitiesWiFI 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1.So HDMI 2.1 was actually somethingI was confused about\\nmissing on the last versionsince it had been out for a little bit.But it\\'s now here and that allows forup to 8K 60FPSs through one\\ncable via the HDMI port.So that\\'s about time.WiFi 6E is just sort of\\nstarting to roll out now,that\\'s gonna be great for future proofing.We literally just got WiFi\\n6E routers in the studiofor the first time and the MacBook Proshave consistently been\\nlike the fastest thingon our wifi network,and it continues to stretch\\nthat lead in that department.And Bluetooth 5.3, again,very much future proofing,\\nbut that\\'s welcome.But really the Apple Silicon\\ntransition has come a long waysince the very first M1 Max that we sawwhen they first started doing this.There are a lot more well optimized apps,it\\'s a lot more obvious\\nwhat the benefits are.It\\'s still not complete, of course,because we don\\'t have a Mac Pro yet,and also it kind of feels like\\nthey forgot about the iMac.That\\'s just chilling, still\\nstuck at M1, for some reason.But really, yeah, these are\\na level up from the rest.And I think my overall\\nrecommendations about what to buyat certain spots in the lineup\\nbasically stays the same.So if you\\'re after battery life,M2 Pro is gonna be awesome,if you\\'re after maximum powerat the expense of some\\nof your battery life,then M2 Max is probably the move.And really my pretty\\ntextbook conclusion hereis these laptops aren\\'t for peoplewho already have the M1\\nPro and M1 Max laptopsthat just came out,they are for people who have older laptopsthat now have a better\\nmachine to upgrade to,unless you\\'re one of a\\ntiny fraction of peoplewho got the old onesand was pushing it to its limitsand just needs that 30% more power,in which case, you know who you are.Matter of fact, for those\\npeople on older laptops,I think looking for sales nowof the M1 Pro and M1 Max,when you start to find deals on those,those are gonna be really good laptops.Now, you might have also seen the rumorsthat it\\'s possible that\\nthe first of the M3 laptopsis gonna be coming out\\nlater this calendar yearon a three nanometer process,and you might be wondering\\nif you should wait for that.To which I would say,\\nyou should actually waittill quarter three of\\n2027 when we have the M5sbecause that\\'ll be 30% faster than the M4swhich is 30% faster than the M3s,and you can see where I\\'m going with this.Like, if you\\'re gonna be\\nwaiting for the next thing,you\\'ll just be waiting forever\\'cause that\\'s just the way tech is.These are great machines,they\\'re more than most people need,and if you can get your hands on the M1s,those are gonna be really\\ngood for most people too.Either way, make sure you get subscribedbecause I think,I think actually the new M2 Mac Minisare a way more interesting machine,so stay tuned for that video.Also, I said something\\nin in my last review.With that being said,if the next version of this laptopstill has a notch this big\\nand doesn\\'t add Face ID,I\\'ll wear socks and sandals\\nfor a day, like Linus.Like, they gotta be planning onputting it there eventually, right?Well, all day today,I\\'m a man of my word.Thanks for watching,catch you guys in the next one, peace.(upbeat music)',\n",
       " \"if you're looking to buy a new macbookit's probably never been this confusingto figure out which one you should buyespecially now that the controversial m2macbooks have joined the lineup butdon't worry i can guarantee that if youstick through this video to the endyou'll know exactly which macbook isright for you but before we get intoexplaining all of the differencesbetween these macbooks i've gotta talkabout the prices for each one in thelineup starting with the m1 air whichretails for a thousand dollars but youcan find on sale on amazon for as low as850 bucks then we have the redesigned m2air for 1200which hasn't went on sale yet the m2macbook pro which retails at 1300 but iscurrently on sale for 1200 bucks the 14inch macbook pro for 2 000or 1800 on sale on amazon and the 16inch macbook pro for 2500or only 2 200 on sale which is a crazygood deal and now getting into thedifferences the first thing i want todiscuss is the design and portabilitywhich in this case the new redesigned m2macbook air is by far the fittest ofthem all and the most portable in termsof the footprint being quite similar tothe m1 macbook air while the 16-inch ismassive in comparison as well as beingby far the heaviest at 4.8 pounds about78 heavier than the empty air but interms of the overall design itself theair is basically a smaller version ofthe 14 and 16 inch macbook pros so itlooks amazing compared to the olderlooking m1 air and m2 macbook pro whichunfortunately did not get a redesign anddon't come with max a fast chargingsupport like the others do now in termsof the keyboards and the track padsthey're all very similar with the newerstyle of magic keys which are very nicehowever the m2 macbook pro is the onlyone that still has the touch bar which idon't really care for because i preferthe function keys with the built-intouch id sensor which all of them haveand as far as the track pads they allhave basically the same one with largertrack pads as you get to the moreexpensive and larger macbook pros whichis nice and they're force touch so theybeat out all of the other windowslaptops out there now in terms of theports all three of the lower end m1 andm2 macbooks come with two thunderbolt 3ports and a headphone jack while thenewer m2 models do support highimpedance headphones and only the m2 aircomes with the max safe 3 port in termsof the bottom end and of course both the14 and 16 inch come with the max a3 portthey actually come with threethunderbolt 4 ports which are faster andon the other end they come with an sdxccard slot and an hdmi 2.0 port so theseare by far the best in terms of theactual ports and connectivity andthey're also the best in terms of thedisplay support because they supportbetween two and four displays combiningthe thunderbolt ports with the hdmi portwhile the lower end m1 and m2 modelsonly support one external displaywithout using any additional extrahardware now moving on to the actualdisplays there are a lot of differencesto talk about but the biggest one is thenotch and notch list designs as you cansee the m1 and the m2 pro have the olddesign so they do not come with a notchwhich also means that they only comewith 720p webcams compared to 1080p onthe m2 air and the 14 and 16 inch andi'm gonna show you guys the differencesin just a minute and in terms of theactual knits or the brightness of thedisplays the m2 pro and the m2 air have500 nits while the older m1 comes with400 and these all have pretty good colorsupport with p3 wide color gamut while ithink the m2 air does support 10 billioncolors in terms of the software supportso that's really nice but the 14 and 16inch come with much better mini leddisplays compared to the conventionallcds which can actually go up to a peakof 1600 nits or a thousand that'ssustained across the entire screen witha white page for hours and hours on endso that is really really nice for hdrediting or color grading but when you'reusing them in normal use cases they'relimited to 500 just like these m2macbooks however you can download thevivid app using the link below to unlockthe full sustained a thousand nits ofbrightness all the time without anyrisks or issues because that's how applebuilds them to work so definitely checkthat out but in terms of the actualdisplay quality these mini led displayslook really nice because they give youbetter colors that pop out more and theyhave much deeper blacks which gobasically all the way pitch blackbecause the actual backlight is turnedoff in those areas with local dimmingzones so they look really nice comparedto the lcd displays that have basicallygray all around the display and not onlythat but the 14 and 16 inch macbook prosalso support 120hz refresh ratepromotion which means that when you'rebrowsing or playing games or whateveryou get up to 120 hertz of refresh rateso it looks super smooth and a lot morepleasant compared to these other lowerend macbooks that are stuck at 60 hertzall the time and now with that saidlet's talk about the speaker quality nowthe m2 air did get a new system withfour speakers but to be honest itdoesn't sound that much better than them2 pro or the m1 air in fact some peoplestill think the m1 air sounds better andthat might be because there are nolonger speaker grilles on the m2 airbecause it got smaller but if you reallycare about speaker quality the 14 and 16inch sound a lot better especially the16 inch which has the most volume and byfar the most bass just hear it foryourself[Applause][Music][Applause][Music][Music]and just like i mentioned before the m1air and the m2 macbook pro are stillstuck with the 720p webcams compared to1080p on the m2 air and the 14 and16-inch macbook pros so check out thisclip and also listen for the microphonedifferences as well this is the webcamand microphone quality on the m1 macbookair this is the webcam and microphonequality on the new m2 macbook air thisis the webcam and microphone quality onthe new m2 macbook pro this is thewebcam and microphone quality on the14-inch macbook pro and this is thewebcam and microphone quality on the16-inch macbook pro now in terms ofbattery life the m2 macbook pro is goingto give you the best because with the m2chip it has four efficiency cores whichare combined with a pretty decentlysized battery and a small 13-inch 60hzdisplay which uses less power than theselarger machines now beyond that you'regoing to get better battery life withthe m2 air and then following the m1 airand then finally the 14 and 16 inchmacbook pros have the least amount ofbattery life in terms of the generallineup and now with that said gettinginto the cpu performance we have somedifferences here of course the m2 chipsare clocked the highest with the latesttechnology so they have the fastestsingle core performance and thatactually helps make the whole systemfeel snappy and load things up faster aswell as giving you faster web browsingperformance which is actually reallyimpressive compared to even the 14 and16 inch macbook pros now because thesechips have more performance cores theyalso have the most multi-coreperformance and even the bend base model14 inch m1 pro has a lot moreperformance than the m2 chip so keepthat in mind for all of your programslike let's say xcode programming orrunning a lot of tracks and logic proyou also have the lightroom photoediting as well which is now using a bitmore of the gpu but still it relies onsome cpu so if you have some tasks thatrely on the cpu of course the 14 and16-inch macbook pros are gonna be thebest now in terms of graphics we have asimilar story the base m1 air is gonnahave the least amount of performancebecause it has a seven core bend modelwhich you can upgrade to the eight corebut of course the m2 air comes with that8 core already at the base price andit's quite a bit faster honestly than itwas last year now the m2 air can beupgraded from an 8 core to a 10 core butbecause it's fanless you might not seethat big of gains so we honestly don'trecommend upgrading to the 10 core on atleast the air model and of course the 14and 16 inch have the m1 pro and m1 maxwith insane numbers of graphics cores upto 32 on the m1 max so if you care a lotabout graphics performance youdefinitely want to stick with these twoand if you're confused on which one youshould buy in terms of the m1 the m2 them1 pro and the m1 max chips i wouldhonestly say that these ones especiallythe m1 max are really only for thepeople who are very serious aboutproductivity work and also for those whouse their macbook for business wheretime is money and it's worth spendingmore to get your work done as fast aspossible but for everybody else honestlythe m1 pro is definitely more than fastenough and even the m2 chip is more thanfast enough for the majority of peopleout there and now with that said i dowant to address some of the issues thatwe've been seeing with the m2 macbooksfirst of all if you're getting the base256 gigs of storage you could have someslow downs in terms of the actualtransfer speeds because this m2 macbookair and the macbook pro in terms of thebase storage is actually two timesslower than the base m1 error which ischeaper in terms of the read speed soyou could actually get some lowermultitasking performance if you're doingsome productivity work so keep that inmind and because of that we recommendupgrading to at least five twelve gigsof storage on these m2 machines youdon't necessarily have to do that on them1 air because it does have the fasterssds in the base model so that's nice ifyou're really trying to save money butthese two machines the 14 and 16 alreadycome with 512 which is a pretty decentstarting point and of course you canupgrade to one terabyte on thesemachines which is worth it if you'realready spending that much money now interms of the ram these machines comewith eight gigs standard while the 14and 16 come with 16 gigs which i wouldsay is a decent area to stay at unlessyou're doing a lot of productivity workthen you might want to upgrade but interms of these if you're doing a lot ofproductivity work and multitasking iwould definitely recommend going up to16 gigs of ram however that creates anissue because with the m2 air if youupgrade to the 512 gig ssd and then youalso upgrade to 16 gigs of ram you'relooking at 1600while of course this 14 inch macbook proyou can get on sale for 1800 and it hasa ton of advantages over the m2 macbookair so i would say if you really careenough about productivity to upgrade theram on the m2 you might as well just belooking at these higher end machines sowith that said let me get into mybuyer's guide portion where i recommendwho should buy each one of thesemacbooks now starting with the m1macbook air this is perfect for theperson who's just trying to get intoapple laptops and wants to spend alittle bit of money because you can buyit for 850 dollars which is a killerdeal basically destroying all otherwindows laptops so if you have lightusage or some light business use this isgreat now as far as the m2 macbook air ithink this one is for those people whoreally want the fresh redesign who likethe new design who like the notch thebetter display that is for those peoplethat are willing to spend the money onthe extra design now in terms of the m2macbook prothat's for the people who don't want togo up to the 14 inch they absolutelycan't spend 1800 but they do want a fanfor extended workloads which honestly iwould really recommend going for the 14inch if you're considering the fan withthe m2 macbook pro but of course it'sthere for those people who just cannotsqueeze out any more budget now ofcourse the 14 inch i would say is theoverall best value of all if you'redoing productivity work definitely andthe 16 inch is for those who really lovethe large display they love the betterspeakers the better battery life thatyou can get compared to the 14 inch andof course those who really want to goall out with the m1 max chip trying toget as much possible performance as theycan get so with that said i have linksdown below to all of these macbooks allthe sales that you can find especiallythe crazy good deal 2200 for the 16 inchor 850 for this m1 macbook air[Music]\"]"

       " 'text': \"all right so this is the new 13-inch m2macbook pro and i don't think anyoneshould actually buy it wait what yeah noi think it's a great computer first ofall don't get me wrong but with theintroduction of the m2 macbook air andthe existence of the 14-inch m1 promacbook pro they've managed to squeezeany reason for this machine to exist atthis priceto basically zero nobody should buy ityeah but nobody that i mean that seemspretty harsh matter of fact i'm here letme challenge you on thatthis is a great computer changed my mindokay well let's just start with thedesign so apple's been going throughtheir laptop lineup upgrading everythingwith this new square shape largerdisplays with thinner bezels getting ridof the touch bar and actually addingports but this particular refresh didn'tget any of that so this brand new laptoplooks exactly the same as the m1 macbookpro from two years ago which looksexactly the same as the 13-inch intelmacbook pro with the touch bar thatdropped in 2016 because it is exactlythe same i could give him sustainabilitycredit i guess for recycling an olddesign and apparently using the sameboxes from the m1 macbook pro just withnew stickers on them but yeah this exactshell design is literally six years oldand is starting to look kind of out ofplace now next to apple's othernotebooks like can you imagine any othercompany trying to reuse a six-year-olddesign like you trying to tell me a2016 asus laptop re-release would flytoday like a six-year-old xps drop likethat's wild yeah but this isn't thatlike let me tell you uh if it ain'tbroke don't fix it and i'm not justsaying that like this is a really goodlaptop design all metal jacket a plushinge and let me just remind you youreviewed it and you loved it the screenwas bright and high resolution still isthe speakers were best in class stillare great track pad and keyboard and bythe way some people do really like thetouch bar you said so yourself it mightnot do a whole lot but it still has itsfew advantages okay but that that is ina vacuum like that's the thing by itselfi would agree with you this computer isa perfectly good laptop buy it but assoon as you put it alongside the newmacbook air which is basically the sameprice it's actually worse at basicallyeverything like i got hands on time withthe new m2 macbook air that's about tocome out next month right the air has alarger display with thinner bezels andin that notch there's a new 1080p webcaminstead of a 6 year old 720p webcam ithas magsafe with a color matching cablewhich enables fast charging andessentially frees up an extra port sincethat's one more usb-c port that you'renot plugged into and it's all in apackage that's thinner weighs less andis basically the same price so why wouldyou buy this macbook pro how is it evenpro anymore you know what that's a goodquestion why would you buythis prothe answer i think first of all is it isthe cheapest pro in the lineuptechnically it's true but really thereason you get this over the air is thethicker chassis supports active coolingso it's got a fan and all the benefitsthat come with that i mean thebenchmarks are in and to the surprise ofabsolutely no one it's pretty clear thatthis m2 chip is awesome it's living upto the 10 to 20 percent bettermulti-core cpu performance and even moreimpressively the two extra gpu coresover m1 is giving it 30 to 40 percentbetter gpu performance which isbasically the only area where you couldsay m1 was lacking so this is awesomefor any applications that lean on thegpu everything's faster final cut isfaster premiere is faster any games youmight play are all faster and the cherryon top is it has a dramatically improvedmedia engine same one from the higherend chips actually so you can actuallypull off some heavier final cut proedits so for something like that whileyou're in a program for hours and thingsare getting hot okay that's when youneed the fans to kick in keepperformance highlonger than the macbook air ever couldno throttling so if you've got thesustained workloads and the longperformance stuff you should get the m2macbook pro no no those people shouldjust go straight to the 14 inch m1 promacbook pro just go straight to the bigbrother look if you know you're going tobe doing workloads and things that themacbook air can't handlethen you should just go to the actuallypro laptop the upgraded machineif you're going to get a nice laptop andyou want to do extra performance stuffon it you weren't going to get thebaseline macbook pro right you weregoing to bump it up first of all becauseyou want at least 16 gigs of memoryright and second of all because the 256gigs of baseline pro storage is kind ofinsulting and that version hasparticularly clipped ssd performanceworse than even the m1 macbook pro so toget to one terabyte and 16 gigs you'realready looking at like 1900for this machineat that pointjust get the 14 inch pro because thatlaptop is on another level ofperformance i mean don't get me wrongit's absolutely awesome to see the jumpfrom m1 to m2 and that's going to enablea ton more great stuff for the mostpopular laptop for the everyday baselineusers but if you zoom out there's stilla big difference in performance whenmoving up to the higher end chips m1 proand then m1 max the amount of additionalperformance you get for the extra two tothree hundred dollars is massive ifthat's what you really want that's whatyou should get plus you get a muchbetter brighter mini led high refreshrate screen tooand the webcam and the notch is waybetter much better speakers and actuallyget some ports while you're at it so ijust i don't know you shouldn't get aliteral worse version of all of thosethings i mean two to three hundred bucksisn't nothingi meanit's not zero but likei don't know really squeezes this newmacbook pro quite a bit and plus youcan't get around the fact that it's it'sliterally worse at all those things ithink you're forgetting something uh ohreally the macbook pro has studioquality microphones while the macbookair does not umi mean so technically they both arelisted as having triple microphonearrays with beamforming it's just applechose to call the one in the macbook prostudio quality it might have a slightdifference but really are you gonna payextra for that and then sacrifice allthis other stuff okay i think there isone redeeming factorand what is thatbatterythe macbook pro has surprisinglyexcellent battery life better than ithink pretty much all of us expected wesaw the 20 hours of video playbackquoted on stage but in real world usethis might be the best battery life inany modern laptop we've ever seenthere's people out here getting 16 to 20hours of actual real world use theverge's laptop reviewer monica wrote ahilarious piece about how long it tookher to run down a battery and across theboard it's a tremendously long performerso if you want the best battery in anylaptop get this one okay so that isawesome to seebut at the same time those other laptopsalready have great battery life too soyou're not trying to spendjust to get a slightly better batteryand then sacrifice all those otherthings we talked aboutit's really quite a small difference uhso the ideal customer for this newmacbook pro m2is somebody who just needs a slightlybetter sustained performance than thenew macbook air and is willing tosacrifice screen size webcam speakersports thickness and weight to get itor someone who is literally about to buythe 13-inch m1 macbook proenterpriseyep enterprise that's
